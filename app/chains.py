            some `experience` in the resume. If there is no `experience` in the resume then talk about academic experience through projects else talk about 
            the person's `experience` in the resume like what did they do in the company and what skills were used but only when there is some `experience` in
            the resume. Talk about the person's `projects` in brief if no `experience` (in bullet points). Mention a few lines about the `certifications` as well.
            The mail should be formal and a minimum of 2-3 paragraphs long. The mail should be in first person format like you are the person who is applying 
            for the job. Also mention that you have attached the resume in the mail for further reference. Make the mail convincing. At the end after the name,
            add the linkedin url, and the `mobile no.` of the person from their resume. Add a little space after every paragraph.
